# TODO:

- Open API Notes:
    - Open API just defines a specific syntax to describe APIs and how to consume them
    - Ensures our API is both human and machine readable
    - Used by other software to generate code
    - Use editor.swagger.io to explore API

- A draft database schema with PostGIS (db/schema.sql) including spatial and common indexes.
    - SQL that defines the schema

- A short architecture document (docs/architecture-v1.md) describing components and data flow.
